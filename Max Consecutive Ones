Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Note:

    The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
    The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000


Solution:
var findMaxConsecutiveOnes = function(nums) {
    let str = nums.join("").split("0").map(x => x.length);
    return Math.max(...str);
};
